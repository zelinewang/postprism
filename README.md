</div>

PostPrism is a full-stack app built for the ORGO AI hackathon. Rather than a black-box automation, it gives each platform its own computer-use agent in an isolated ORGO cloud VM, streams every agent's screen back to one dashboard, and rewrites the post per platform. Front end: React + TypeScript (Vite). Back end: Flask + [Agent S2.5](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S) with [UI-TARS 1.5](https://github.com/bytedance/UI-TARS) visual grounding.

> **On the numbers in this README:** performance figures, success rates, and market/ROI projections come from the hackathon demo and the author's own estimates. They are illustrative, not independently benchmarked.

## Quick start

The front end builds and runs on [Bun](https://bun.sh/); this demo mode needs no API keys.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zelinewang/postprism-12e78c39.git
cd postprism-12e78c39
bun install
bun run build    # verified: 1769 modules transformed, built in ~2s
bun run dev      # front end at http://localhost:8080
```

For the full agent back end (ORGO + OpenAI keys and real parallel publishing), see [Setup](#setup).

## 👨‍💻 **About This Solo Project**

### **Development Context**

**The technical scope accomplished:**
- Frontend application (React/TypeScript)
- Backend orchestration (Flask/Python)
- Agent S2.5 integration with custom optimizations
- ORGO VM management and parallel execution
- Real-time video streaming system by WebSocket
- Performance monitoring and analytics

**Most challenging:** Agent S2.5 dropped on August 1st, and migrating from S2 to S2.5 less than 24 hours before deadline proved... interesting. Successfully integrated the latest SOTA agent, but it required deploying custom grounding models and significant infrastructure investment.

### 📝 A Note to Hackathon Judges

Hey there! Thanks for checking my submission for this ORGO AI hackathon, and thank you for the opportunity to let me explore ORGO.AI.

I wanted to share a bit of context about this project that might not be immediately obvious from the code alone.

**This project genuinely consumed a significant amount of my time (and wallet) 💸 (bye~)** and here's why:

Agent S2.5 literally dropped on August 1st, and me being me, I thought "Hey, why not just migrate from the old Agent S2 architecture to the new S2.5! It seems awesome!" Yeah... that wasn't my smartest decision indeed less than 24hrs before the submission. 😅

**The reality hit hard:**

- Agent S2.5 was SOOOOO new that debugging felt like disaster
- Had to deploy a separate grounding model (yes, additional infrastructure costs, and it's a lot.)
- Blew way past my Cursor Pro plan limits and I need to do pay as you go (I DID NOT know I really could reach the limit before this lol)
- But hey, I kept pushing and optimizing because I'm stubborn like that

**The thing is** - I eventually DID successfully integrate the latest Agent S2.5! Was it extra work? Absolutely. Was it worth it? I think so! I just wanted to give this project and ORGO.AI applications the best shot I could.

I'm not expecting to win any awards here. My coding isn't perfect, and I know there are probably way better performed projects out there.

**My one tiny hope though** 🤞 - would there be any possibility of getting reimbursed for the infrastructure costs? They are:

- HuggingFace endpoint deployment for the grounding model
- Cursor Pro overage fees (I went HAM on the coding sessions)
- Claude/OpenAI/etc API usage costs
- Other API fees

Since the hackathon didn't provide credits/supports for these kind of resources, I ended up paying out of pocket. We're probably looking at over hundred dollars here... 😬

Since I'm still a student with no income right now :3, so these costs genuinely put a dent in my budget. (Also low-key looking for job opportunities in a couple months too!!!!! orz) But I was so excited about pushing the boundaries with Orgo + Agent S2.5 that I figured "cause why not" and went for it anyway.

**But honestly?** I genuinely enjoyed diving deep into new orgo.ai and experimenting with cutting-edge agents. The learning experience was great! Not here to win, but here because I love building stuff.

If there's any way to help with those expenses, that would be absolutely awesome! (love to keep working on this tbh, I feel like there is more potential in this projet) But totally understand if not! Thanks for taking the time to review my project! 🙏

*P.S. - Sorry for the novel, but I figured transparency was better than leaving you wondering why some parts of the code look like they were written at 3 AM (because they probably were) 😂*

## 🏆 **Why PostPrism Wins the ORGO Challenge**

### 🎯 **Maximum ORGO Potential Utilization**

**Most projects use ORGO like this (basic):**
```python
# Standard approach - Limited potential
computer = Computer()
computer.click(100, 200)
computer.type("Hello")
```

**PostPrism unleashes ORGO's true power:**
```python
# Revolutionary architecture maximizing ORGO advantages
self.isolated_environments = {
    'linkedin': {
        'vm': Computer(project_id=linkedin_vm_id),     # Dedicated ORGO VM
        'agent': AgentS2_5(ui_tars_1_5),              # Latest SOTA agent
        'state': PersistentLoginState(),               # Never re-authenticate
        'fingerprint': UniqueDigitalID()               # Anti-detection
    },
    'twitter': {...},    # Completely isolated execution
    'instagram': {...}   # Zero interference possible
}

# Result: True parallelism + persistent state + 3x performance
await asyncio.gather(*[
    self._publish_with_transparency(env)
    for env in self.isolated_environments.values()
])
```

## Setup

**Note:** Current demo manages 3 accounts (LinkedIn, Twitter, Instagram), but designed to scale to 100+ accounts across multiple platforms.

### **🎯 Prerequisites**

#### **1. ORGO AI Account & VM Setup**
**⚠️ CRITICAL: This enables the parallel architecture**

```bash
# Step 1: Get ORGO API Access
# Sign up at: https://docs.orgo.ai/introduction

# Step 2: Create 3 Dedicated VMs (one for each platform)
LinkedIn VM    → Project ID: "proj_linkedin_abc123" (save this!)
Twitter VM     → Project ID: "proj_twitter_def456" (save this!)
Instagram VM   → Project ID: "proj_instagram_ghi789" (save this!)

# Step 3: The Secret Sauce - Persistent Login Setup
# For each VM:
1. Connect to VM via ORGO interface
2. Open browser → Navigate to platform → Login
3. ✅ CRITICAL: Keep browser open, stay logged in
4. Test: Refresh page → Should remain logged in

# Why This Works:
# - ORGO VMs maintain state when paused
# - No re-authentication needed = faster publishing
# - Each VM has unique IP = anti-detection
```

#### **2. Agent S2.5 Configuration**
```bash
# Required: OpenAI API Key
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
AGENTS2_5_MODEL=o3-2025-04-16              # Recommended by Agent S2.5 team
# but we use gpt-4o-mini for speed

# Required: UI-TARS 1.5 Grounding Model
AGENTS2_5_GROUNDING_URL=https://your-endpoint.endpoints.huggingface.cloud
AGENTS2_5_GROUNDING_API_KEY=hf_your_token_here
```

#### **3. Environment Configuration**
Create `.env` file:
```bash
# 🔑 ORGO AI Configuration (ESSENTIAL!)
ORGO_API_KEY=your_orgo_api_key_here

# 🎯 Platform-Specific VM IDs
ORGO_LINKEDIN_PROJECT_ID=proj_linkedin_abc123
ORGO_TWITTER_PROJECT_ID=proj_twitter_def456
ORGO_INSTAGRAM_PROJECT_ID=proj_instagram_ghi789

# 🤖 AI Model Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-your_openai_key_here
AGENTS2_5_MODEL=o3-2025-04-16
# but we use gpt-4o-mini for speed

# 🎨 UI-TARS 1.5 Configuration
AGENTS2_5_GROUNDING_URL=your_grounding_endpoint
AGENTS2_5_GROUNDING_API_KEY=your_grounding_key
AGENTS2_5_GROUNDING_MODEL=ui-tars-1.5-7b

# ⚡ Performance Optimizations
ENABLE_ANTI_PERFECTIONISM=true
ENABLE_LOOP_DETECTION=true
ENABLE_LIVE_STREAMING=true
```

### **🚀 Installation & Launch**

#### **Method 1: One-Click Setup**
```bash

### **Automated Installation (From [`install_dependencies.sh`](./backend/install_dependencies.sh))**

The installation script handles these components automatically:
1. **Python Virtual Environment** - Isolated dependency management
2. **Standard Dependencies** - Flask 3.0+, SocketIO 5.3+, OpenAI 1.25+, etc. ([`requirements.txt`](./backend/requirements.txt))
3. **GUI Agents S2.5** - Latest v0.2.5 (Aug 2025) from [official repository](https://github.com/simular-ai/Agent-S)
4. **ORGO AI Client** - Virtual desktop orchestration (`pip install orgo`)
5. **Production Enhancements** - Gunicorn, Eventlet, performance optimizations
6. **Environment Setup** - Interactive configuration wizard via `setup_env.py`

**Installation Command**: `chmod +x install_dependencies.sh && ./install_dependencies.sh`

### **Port Configuration**
- **Frontend**: `http://localhost:8080` (Vite dev server)
- **Backend**: `http://localhost:8000` (Flask application)
- **Health Check**: `http://localhost:8000/health`

### **Deployment Options (From [`DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md`](./DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md))**

#### **Option 1: Demo Mode (No Setup)**
```bash
# Frontend only - perfect for presentations
npm install && npm run dev
echo "VITE_DEMO_MODE=true" > .env.local
```

#### **Option 2: Full Production**
```bash
# Automated setup using our installation script
cd backend && chmod +x install_dependencies.sh && ./install_dependencies.sh
cd .. && npm install
cp env.example.txt .env  # Edit with your API keys
npm run dev & python backend/run_fixed.py
```

#### **Option 3: Cloud Deployment**
- **Frontend**: Deploy to [Lovable](https://postprism.lovable.app)
- **Backend**: Deploy to Railway/Render with environment variables
- **Configuration**: See [`DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md`](./DEPLOYMENT_STRATEGY.md) for detailed steps

### **Troubleshooting (From [`SETUP_GUIDE.md`](./SETUP_GUIDE.md))**

**Common Issues & Solutions:**
```bash
# Backend connection failed
curl http://localhost:8000/health

# OpenAI rate limits
AGENTS2_5_MODEL=gpt-4o-mini  # Use cheaper model

# ORGO VM access issues
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $ORGO_API_KEY" https://api.orgo.ai/health

# Installation verification
python backend/run_fixed.py --test
```
